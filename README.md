# Train-Scheduler

This app is designed to incorporate firebase's cloud services and store data for a hypothetical train schedule.
The app will retrieve and manipulate the information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
